## A bit of history

I often experiment with different models in PyTorch to understand how various features affect model quality.

At some point, I realized that many code fragments kept moving from one experiment to another.
Sometimes I update or improve them.
Sometimes I just use them as they are.

But many tasks (such as loading and augmenting datasets, logging, and visualizing results) are just routine.
I don't want to rewrite or redesign them every time.
I only want to do this once!

Thatâ€™s how I decided to create this repository. ðŸ˜Š
